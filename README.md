<h2>README</h2>
The project was previously done in the JetBrains Pycharm IDE.
There were several files performinig different functions.
Later, I transformed all the previous codes to a single  notebook for better readability and understaning.
The single notebook is capable of performing all the previous tasks, from reading images to preprocessing them, training the model and making classification.
For more details about the model, please refer to the final report pdf file.


<h2> The future works that can be performed to improve the model </h2>
<ul>
  <li> More quality data can be used to train the model. </li>
  <li> Even larger balanced data set can be used </li>
  <li> Number of kernels and layers can be increased </li>
  <li> Number of Nuerons can be increased for Fully Connected Layers </li>
  <li> Paremeters like batch size, number of epochs, learning rate, etc. can be altered to experiment the accuracy </li>
 </ul>
