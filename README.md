The project was previously done in the JetBrains Pycharm IDE.
There were several files performinig different functions.
Later, I transformed all the previous codes to a single  notebook for better readability and understaning.
The single notebook is capable of performing all the previous tasks, from reading images to preprocessing them, training the model and making classification.
For more details about the model, please refer to the final report pdf file.
